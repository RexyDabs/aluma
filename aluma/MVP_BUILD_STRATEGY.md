# Aluma Trade Services SaaS - MVP Build Strategy

## Executive Summary

Aluma is currently **40-50% complete** toward a functional MVP. The app has a solid architectural foundation with Next.js 15, Supabase, and modern UI components, but requires critical database schema fixes and completion of core business workflows to become a viable trade services management platform.

**Target MVP Completion**: 3-4 weeks with focused development
**Primary Blocker**: Database schema mismatches with application code

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Strengths (What's Working)**

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication Foundation**: Supabase Auth integration with demo accounts
- **UI Components**: Professional design system with shadcn/ui
- **Role-Based Architecture**: Comprehensive RBAC system (Admin, Manager, Technician, Subcontractor, Staff)
- **Real-time Foundation**: Supabase subscriptions for live updates
- **Professional Design**: Responsive layouts and modern UX patterns

### ‚ùå **Critical Gaps (Blocking MVP)**

1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Code references non-existent tables
2. **Incomplete Task Management**: Core task creation/management missing
3. **Missing User Management**: No user creation/invitation system
4. **Broken Data Flows**: Lead-to-Job conversion incomplete
5. **No Invoicing System**: Referenced but not implemented
6. **Time Tracking Gaps**: Interface exists but functionality incomplete

## Essential Schema Updates (PRIORITY 1)

### New Schema Files Created

1. **`mvp-essential-schema.sql`** - Complete database structure
2. **`mvp-seed-data.sql`** - Realistic test data for development

### Key Database Changes Required

```sql
-- Core tables that need immediate implementation
‚úÖ users, roles, user_roles (enhanced)
‚úÖ clients, client_contacts, client_sites
‚úÖ leads, lead_contacts
‚úÖ jobs, job_assignments
‚úÖ job_tasks, task_assignments (NEW - critical for MVP)
‚úÖ time_entries (NEW - essential for billing)
‚úÖ proposals, proposal_items
‚úÖ invoices (NEW - required for business viability)
```

### Implementation Priority

1. **Week 1**: Run new schema, fix authentication
2. **Week 2**: Complete task management system
3. **Week 3**: Implement invoicing and time tracking
4. **Week 4**: Mobile optimization and testing

-- 3. Run mvp-seed-data.sql for testing
-- 4. Implement gradual migration for any existing data
```

### Code Architecture Updates

```typescript
// Priority component implementations:
1. components/TaskManager.tsx - Complete task management
2. components/TaskCreator.tsx - Smart task creation
3. components/InvoiceGenerator.tsx - Invoice creation
